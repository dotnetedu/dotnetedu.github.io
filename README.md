I want to start with a state's standards and build a prototype course. Over time, we would identify other states and then identify the delta to implement the course to their standards.

The ideal course would be a superset of each state's standards for a "programming" class. I am trying to make this distinct from Computer Science (there are a ton of good CompSci stuff already) and make this more of a course about a trade. A course you can take at a tech center.

Here's some goals:
- Write and maintain the courses entirely in Markdown
    - Worksheets should be done in Markdown
    - Textbooks should be authored in Markdown
    - Textbooks can be browsed online using the website or GitHub repo
    - Textbooks are automatically build using CI into PDF files
- Presentations should be authored some text format and displayed using an easy-to-use HTML5 slide tool 
    - Slide presentations should be frictionless for instructors
- Each lesson should have a document with the mapping information for state objectives
    - This document should be outside of the lesson so that the lesson doesn't grow out-of-control as we bring on more state standards
- There should be a syllabus
- There should be a map of each objective, the corresponding lessons and then the corresponding activities
- There should be some guide on how to get started delivering this material

**My end goal is to build a course that a teacher can pick up, learn over a week or month and then deliver without being required to build any material (worksheets, lesson plans, slides, quizzes or tests).**

The first course will be [Intro to Programming using C#](https://github.com/dotnetedu/intro_to_programming). It's a good starting point since it's OO (like Java) and I already know the language really well :laughing:.
